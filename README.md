# Image-segmentation-model-Pipe-segmentation
The model architecture is inspired by DeepLabv3+ and SqueezeNet model. The SqueezeNet is used as backbone in the model and ASPP module is used for capturing multi-scale
image feature. The model architecture is shown in the Fig.

The pipe dataset has collected in diffrent luminance condition and in diffrent camera to improve the robustness in model output. The image augmentation has been applied to avoid overfitting and improve model performance. The augmentation images is shown in the Fig.


The model output is shown in the Fig. and the performance parameter is listed in the table.
